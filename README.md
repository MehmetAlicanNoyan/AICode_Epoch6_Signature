# FruitPunch AI Code epoch 6: Signature Verification Challenge

AI Code is an initiative by fruitpunch where students can learn to apply AI together by solving a challenge under supervision of an expert. This repository contains the challenge files for epoch 6.

# Challenge description

This week we will build an ML model for signature verification i.e. tell if a signature is genuine or forged. The challenge is based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02131). You will try to implement the architecture described in the paper.

This challenge is prepared by [Mehmet Alican Noyan](https://github.com/MehmetAlicanNoyan).
